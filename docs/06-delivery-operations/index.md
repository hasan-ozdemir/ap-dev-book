# Delivery & Operations

Ship confidently across Apple App Store, Google Play, and Microsoft Store while maintaining rigorous release management practices. This section captures policy changes, checklists, and operational routines required to keep Prodyum products compliant and resilient.citeturn0news12turn0search7turn1search6
Prodyum release managers use these routines daily, and we publish them openly so partner studios and independent teams can mirror the same disciplined operating model.

## Modules

- [Store Readiness Checklist](./store-readiness.md)
- Submission guides:
  - [Apple App Store & TestFlight](./submission-guides/apple-app-store.md)
  - [Google Play Console](./submission-guides/google-play.md)
  - [Microsoft Store](./submission-guides/microsoft-store.md)
- [Release Management & Feedback Loops](./release-management.md) *(coming soon)*

## Core principles

- **Policy awareness:** Track platform policy updates monthly—recent Apple DMA compliance changes, Google Play target SDK rules, and Microsoft Store onboarding updates require ongoing review.citeturn0news12turn0search7turn1search6
- **Progressive deployment:** Move from internal/beta channels to production with staged rollouts (Apple phased releases, Google Play production tracks) and automated telemetry gates.citeturn0search0turn0search4
- **Customer feedback:** Close the loop by routing store reviews, support tickets, and in-app telemetry into backlog refinement using Microsoft Partner Center review tooling.citeturn1search0turn1search1

Use this playbook in tandem with the [DevOps & Automation](../04-devops/index.md) section to connect automation with governance.
