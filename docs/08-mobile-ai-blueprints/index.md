# Mobile AI Blueprint Catalog

> **Coming soon!**  
> We are refreshing this catalog with modern, high-impact blueprints that align with the 2025 Azure AI and .NET MAUI roadmap. The former PoC playbooks have been archived so we can replace them with sharper, outcome-driven guides.citeturn1search6turn9search0
