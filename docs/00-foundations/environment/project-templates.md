# Project Templates and Repository Organisation

Every mobile squad uses the same repository layout and `dotnet` templates so that a new project can be bootstrapped in hours. This guide explains how we organise .NET MAUI apps, shared libraries, and cloud infrastructure inside a single repo.

## 1. Starter solution blueprint

```
src/
  Contoso.Mobile/
    Contoso.Mobile.csproj
    App.xaml
    App.xaml.cs
    MauiProgram.cs
    Resources/
    Platforms/
      Android/
      iOS/
      MacCatalyst/
      Windows/
  Contoso.Mobile.Tests/
infrastructure/
  bicep/
  github/
tools/
  scripts/
global.json
Directory.Build.props
Directory.Build.targets
```

- `Platforms/` folders contain manifests, Info.plist, and WinUI packaging files.?cite?turn20search0?
- `MauiProgram.cs` hosts the dependency injection shell and `MauiAppBuilder` configuration.?cite?turn20search0?
- `Directory.Build.*` shares build settings, while `Directory.Packages.props` centralises NuGet versions.

## 2. Template creation commands

```powershell
dotnet workload install maui
dotnet new maui -n Contoso.Mobile -o src/Contoso.Mobile
dotnet new xunit -n Contoso.Mobile.Tests -o src/Contoso.Mobile.Tests
```

- `dotnet new maui` produces a ready-to-run solution with XAML pages, `MauiProgram`, and platform folders.?cite?turn20search0?
- Create unit-test projects with xUnit or MSTest templates; UI automation assets (Playwright, etc.) live under `tools/`.

### Blazor Hybrid variant

```powershell
dotnet new maui-blazor -n Contoso.Mobile.Hybrid
```

The Blazor Hybrid template embeds Razor components inside a MAUI shell, enabling a single codebase for web and native UI.?cite?turn1search5?

## 3. Version pinning and workload management

- Because .NET 9 has an 18-month support window, pin SDK `9.0.306` in `global.json` along with the `rollForward` policy.?cite?turn3search0?turn3search2?
- Workload sets are the default in .NET 9; store the rollback manifest generated by `dotnet workload update --print-rollback` inside the repo.?cite?turn11search2?turn11search0?
- Check template updates with `dotnet new search maui` and upgrade via `dotnet new install Microsoft.Maui.Templates::<version>` when required.?cite?turn11search2?

## 4. Branch and folder conventions

- **`main`**: release-ready code; merge only approved release PRs.
- **`develop`**: sprint integration branch; every PR runs the full CI suite.
- **`feature/*`**: short-lived branches scoped to a single work item.
- **`infrastructure/*`**: changes to Bicep, GitHub Actions, or Azure DevOps pipelines.

In the monorepo strategy, each product module sits in its own folder under `src/`; shared NuGet packages are managed through `Directory.Packages.props`.

## 5. Build profiles

Add the following targets to `Contoso.Mobile.csproj`:

```xml
<PropertyGroup Condition="'$(Configuration)|$(TargetFramework)'=='Release|net9.0-android'">
  <PublishTrimmed>true</PublishTrimmed>
  <RunAOTCompilation>true</RunAOTCompilation>
</PropertyGroup>
```

Trimming and AOT reduce package size; follow the MAUI packaging guidance to include platform-specific exemptions where necessary.?cite?turn2search0?

## 6. Clean project checklist

- [ ] `global.json` and `Directory.Build.props` exist and are shared with CI.?cite?turn3search0?
- [ ] `dotnet format` and `maui-check` targets run through `Directory.Build.targets`.
- [ ] `azure-pipelines.yml` or `.github/workflows/ci.yml` is copied from the template.
- [ ] `infrastructure/bicep/` contains App Service, Notification Hub, and Key Vault definitions.
- [ ] `docs/adr/` includes at least one architecture decision record.

This structure enables a new squad to ship a working MAUI + Azure solution within a day; document template updates in `docs/landing/roadmap.md`.
