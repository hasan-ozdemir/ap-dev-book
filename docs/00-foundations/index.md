# Foundations

Level up your baseline so that every team member shares the same technical language before diving into solution design, implementation, or operations. The curriculum is tailored to Prodyum engineers first, while remaining a public reference that any developer can adopt to mirror our standards.

## What you will learn

- **C# language mastery:** Explore every keyword, operator, and control construct shipping with .NET 9 and C# 13 using runnable console snippets.citeturn0search0turn0search2
- **.NET platform fundamentals:** Understand SDK workloads, runtime configurations, and cross-platform project types aligned to the .NET 9 STS roadmap.citeturn0search1
- **Tooling setup:** Configure Visual Studio 2022 version 17.14, .NET SDK 9.0.305, emulators, simulators, and debugging utilities for macOS and Windows developers.citeturn2search1
- **Engineering disciplines:** Internalize clean-code practices such as SOLID, DRY, and pragmatic refactoring patterns that keep .NET MAUI and cloud services maintainable.citeturn3search1turn3search2
- **Collaboration practices:** Adopt current .NET delivery habits--branching, pull requests, dependency injection, and platform governance--to keep distributed teams productive.citeturn3search4turn3search5
