# Language Completion Checklist

Use this tracker during onboarding and quarterly refreshers. Mark each item once you have read the module, run the sample, and applied it in a real task.

| Module | Coverage | Done |
|--------|----------|------|
| Program structure & entry point | `namespace`, `using`, top-level statements | [ ] |
| Types & memory | `struct`, `record`, `ref`, `scoped`, `readonly` | [ ] |
| Control flow | `switch`, pattern matching, async streams | [ ] |
| Object-oriented building blocks | abstraction, inheritance, partial classes | [ ] |
| Generics & collections | constraints, variance, spans | [ ] |
| LINQ fundamentals | query expressions, extension methods | [ ] |
| Asynchrony & concurrency | `async`, `await`, `ValueTask`, channels | [ ] |
| Native interop & unsafe code | `unsafe`, fixed buffers, `ref struct` | [ ] |
| Modern C# 13 features | params collections, partial properties, ref struct interfaces | [ ] |

> Update this checklist during coaching sessions and store it alongside your personal development plan.

Cross-reference the checklist with the official C# version history to confirm you have practiced every feature introduced through C# 13.citeturn0search0
