# MAUI Control Catalog Overview

The catalog is now organized into focused guides so you can dive straight into the controls you need. Pick a category below to view XAML and C# examples, best practices, and platform notes for each control family.

- [Text & Display](./text-display.md)
- [Input & Selection](./input-selection.md)
- [Lists & Collections](./lists-collections.md)
- [Navigation & Pages](./navigation-pages.md)
- [Layouts & Containers](./layouts-containers.md)
- [Media, Web, and Maps](./media-web-maps.md)
- [Shapes & Drawing](./shapes-drawing.md)
- [Command Surfaces](./command-surfaces.md)
- [Composition Patterns](./composition-patterns.md)

> Tip: Pair these guides with the [UI Components & Experience Design](../ui-components.md) playbook for interaction design checklists, accessibility guidance, and component comparison matrices.

Need deeper API references or platform caveats? Keep these guides open alongside Microsoft’s official .NET MAUI control documentation to stay aligned with upstream behaviour and release cadence.citeturn22search0
