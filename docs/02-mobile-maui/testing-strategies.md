## How to use this navigator

1. **Plan** – Start each release planning session by reviewing the [quality operating model](./testing-quality.md#1-quality-operating-model) and updating your squad’s test pyramid targets.
2. **Automate** – Cross-check new features against the [automation sections](./testing-quality.md#2-automated-coverage) to confirm coverage, device labs, and beta telemetry.
3. **Gate** – Before shipping, run through the [implementation checklist](./testing-quality.md#6-implementation-checklist) and capture artefacts for the release ticket.

For detailed test type definitions, tooling comparisons, and AI-assisted workflows, continue to the [Testing Methodologies Playbook](./testing-methods.md).
For platform-level considerations, compare each plan with Microsoft's guidance on testing .NET MAUI apps across devices and clouds.citeturn5search1
