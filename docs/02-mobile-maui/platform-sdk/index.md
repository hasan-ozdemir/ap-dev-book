# Platform SDK Playbooks

These guides show how to extend .NET MAUI apps with native platform APIs while preserving a shared architecture. You’ll map handlers to native controls, call objective APIs through dependency injection, and package deliverables for each store.citeturn4search0turn0search8turn5search4
The recipes are written for Prodyum delivery squads yet stay accessible for any organization that needs a pragmatic bridge between shared MAUI code and native platform capabilities.

## How to use this section

1. Start with the platform you target most frequently (iOS, Android, Windows) and review the architecture overview.
2. Use the feature tables to locate namespaces, native types, and recommended scenarios.
3. Copy the runnable sample code into `samples/ConsoleSnippets` or your MAUI project to validate integrations.
4. Follow the build and checklist sections before shipping to the App Store, Google Play, or Microsoft Store.
