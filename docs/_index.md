# Prodyum – Development Playbook

Welcome to **devyum**, the single source of truth for designing, releasing, and operating production-grade mobile, web, and desktop solutions with .NET 9’s long-term support, .NET MAUI’s cross-platform UI stack, and the Azure services we ship with most often.citeturn11search0turn12search0turn13search0

Every collection is written to keep Prodyum squads aligned while remaining accessible to the broader developer community. Whether you are part of our delivery teams, an ecosystem partner, or an independent engineer looking for pragmatic guidance, you can reuse these blueprints and extend them to fit your context.
