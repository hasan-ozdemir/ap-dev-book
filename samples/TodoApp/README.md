# Prodyum.TodoApp

Reference .NET MAUI application that demonstrates the architecture, tooling, and DevOps practices promoted throughout devyum.

## Planned capabilities

- Clean architecture split (`Core`, `Infrastructure`, `App`) with shared abstractions.
- Offline-first sync using SQLite + Azure App Service APIs.
- Push notifications powered by Azure Notification Hubs.
- Feature flag toggles integrated via Azure App Configuration.
- Automated build pipelines (GitHub Actions, Azure DevOps) for Android, iOS, macOS, and Windows targets.

## Current status

The project scaffolding will be added during the next documentation iteration. Follow the steps in [Project Setup & Scaffolding](../../docs/02-mobile-maui/project-setup.md) to create the baseline in your environment.

## Next steps

1. Scaffold the solution using the CLI commands in the guide above.
2. Commit the initial skeleton to the repository.
3. Implement the first user story: “As a user, I can create, edit, and complete tasks offline.”
